            <h3>Early Revolt in the Philippines</h3>
            <p>The revolution against Spain was sparked in 1896 after Spanish authorities discovered the “Katipunan,” a
                Filipino revolutionary society plotting against their colonisers. It ended in 1902, where Spain lost and
                ceded sovereignty of the Philippines to the United States.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Ambaristo Revolt (1807)</h3>
                <p>The Ambaristo Revolt, also known as the Basi Revolt, was a revolt undertaken from September 16-
                    September 28, 1807. It was led by Pedro Mateo with its events occuring in the present day town of
                    Piddig in Ilocos Norte. This revolt is unique as it revolves around the Ilocanos' love for basi , or
                    sugarcane wine. In 1786, the Spanish colonial government expropriated the manufacture and sale of
                    basi, effectively banning private manufacture of the wine, which was done before expropriation.</p>

                <p>Maniago Revolt led by Don Francisco Maniago, initially caused by natives' protest against the polo
                    and bandala, later became a struggle to free the natives from Spanish rule. The rebels were weakened
                    by Gov. de Lara's cooperation of Arayat chief Macapagal. The Maniago revolt was an uprising in
                    Pampanga during the 1660's. It was a revolt against the Spanish during the colonial period and was
                    named after its leader, Francisco Maniago. During that time, Pampanga drew most of the attention
                    from the religious group because of its relative wealth.They also bore the burden of more tribute,
                    forced labor, and rice exploitation. They were made to work for eight months under unfair conditions
                    and were not paid for their labor and for the rice purchased form them.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Dagohoy Revolt (1744-1829)</h3>
                <p>In 1744 in what is now the province of Bohol, what is known today as the Dagohoy Revolt was
                    undertaken by Francisco Dagohoy and some of his followers. This revolt is unique since it is the
                    only Philippine Revolt completely related to matters of religious customs, although unlike the
                    Tamblot Uprising before it, it is not a complete religious rebellion. The refusal of the priest to
                    give his brother a proper Christian burial eventually led to the longest revolt ever held in
                    Philippines history: 85 years. It also led to the establishment of a free Boholano government.
                    Francisco Dagohoy died two years before the revolt ended, though, which led to the end of the revolt
                    in 1829. Some 19,000 survivors were granted pardon and were eventually allowed to live in new
                    Boholano villages.</p>
